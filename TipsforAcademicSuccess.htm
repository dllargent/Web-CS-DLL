        If you are <i>serious</i> about wanting to do well, I guarantee that these steps will make a difference. 
        Like anything else worthwhile, it will require some
        <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-secret-to-raising-smart-kids/" target="_blank">effort</a>.
    </h3>

    <ol>
        <li>
            Two BSU resources I highly recomend are the 
            <a href="https://www.bsu.edu/academics/collegesanddepartments/universitycollege/learningcenter" target="_blank">Learning Center</a>, 
            and the <a href="https://www.bsu.edu/academics/centersandinstitutes/writingcenter" target="_blank">Writing Center</a>. 
            Check out what they offer and take advantage of their services; you may be surprised.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
            You need regular, aerobic <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5-kbfnCq6M" target="_blank">exercise</a>.
            <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2016/05/04/study-recreational-physical-activities-increase-odds-academic-success" target="_blank">Research</a>
            shows an undeniable <a href="http://www.brainrules.net/exercise?scene=" target="_blank">link</a>
            between <a href="http://www.livestrong.com/article/320144-does-exercise-release-a-chemical-in-the-brain/" target="_blank">exercise</a>
            and <a href="http://www.alz.washington.edu/NONMEMBER/FALL05/cotman.pdf" target="_blank">brain</a>
            function, including memory.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
            Research also shows the importance of adequate <a href="http://www.brainrules.net/sleep" target="_blank">sleep</a>
            on the ability to <a href="http://www.readcube.com/articles/10.1038/nrn2762-c2" target="_blank">remember</a>
            and solve <a href="http://www.psy.cmu.edu/~unsio/sio_monaghan_ormerod_sleep_MC.pdf" target="_blank">problems</a>.
            You may <i>believe</i> that you don’t need a
            lot of <a href="http://www.aasmnet.org/articles.aspx?id=659" target="_blank">sleep</a>, but
            <a href="http://gottfriedschlaug.org/musicianbrain.test/papers/Walker_sleep_motor.pdf" target="_blank">physiological</a>
            <a href="http://healthysleep.med.harvard.edu/healthy/matters/benefits-of-sleep/learning-memory" target="_blank">evidence</a>
            says <a href="http://learnmem.cshlp.org/content/11/6" target="_blank">differently</a>. One
            <a href="http://www.aasmnet.org/articles.aspx?id=4780" target="_blank">study</a> demonstrated that
            poor sleepers are much more likely to get worse grades and withdraw from
            classes.
            And there are some things you can do (and not do) to 
            <a href="https://online.nursing.georgetown.edu/blog/sleeping-well-in-the-digital-age/" target="_blank">get better sleep.</a>
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
            Proper <a href="http://www.livestrong.com/article/503523-vegetables-for-brain-function/" target="_blank">nutrition</a>
            also affects brain function. It’s not just being
            <a href="http://scitechdaily.com/hunger-affects-behavior-and-changes-pathways-in-the-brain/" target="_blank">hungry</a>
            that hurts thinking, but filling up on the <a href="http://www.womenshealthmag.com/food/foods-bad-for-your-brain" target="_blank">wrong foods</a>
            can also be a problem. Foods high in sodium and <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16257476" target="_blank">fat</a> (the stuff of fast
            food franchises) negatively affects the ability to think clearly. <o:p></o:p>
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
            It may be too late to alter your class schedule, but another way to improve learning is
            to <a href="http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1957114,00.html" target="_blank">
                have a break
            </a> after this class rather than go straight into another learning
            situation. Having time just to “daydream” after learning new information is
            helpful. The ability to <a href="http://www.webmd.com/brain/news/20100127/coffee-break-boosts-memory" target="_blank">
                think more
            </a> about what was just learned helps to move the knowledge from
            short-term to long-term <a href="http://keck.ucsf.edu/~loren/Reprints/Karlsson_Frank_Awake_Replay_NatureNeuro_2009.pdf" target="_blank">memory</a>.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
            Attitude about learning may just be the biggest factor. People can actually convince
            </a> themselves that they can’t learn something, and they won’t! You must believe in
            your ability to learn the material, and then <a href="http://chronicle.com/article/The-7-Fundamental-Conditions/229275/" target="_blank">
                care enough about the content
            </a> to <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>want</i>
            to learn it. Your <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1074742707000299" target="_blank">interest</a>
            in the subject is a big factor in your learning.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
            <a href="http://www2.fiu.edu/~schwartb/Schwartz_21-2_.pdf" target="_blank">Studying</a> more often
            for shorter periods of time is <a href="http://uweb.cas.usf.edu/~drohrer/pdfs/Pashler_et_al_2007PB&amp;R.pdf" target="_blank">better</a>
            than longer, less frequent study sessions. <a href="http://www.psychologicalscience.org/observer/0301/prescol.html" target="_blank">Ideally</a>
            you should put in a study session to prep before every class (where you read
            the assignment), and a session after each class to
            <a href="http://science.howstuffworks.com/life/inside-the-mind/human-brain/human-memory2.htm" target="_blank">review</a>
            your notes. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3782739/" target="_blank">
            Leaving it all</a> until the day before the tests is not a good strategy.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
            Attendance and active engagement in class really do make a difference. You
            might be <a href="http://science.howstuffworks.com/life/inside-the-mind/human-brain/human-memory1.htm" target="_blank">listening</a>
            to what is happening in class, but your mind may wander if you’re not <i>actively</i> listening.
            <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/02/education/edlife/take-notes-from-the-pros.html" target="_blank">
                Effective note taking
            </a> matters. Some students really don’t know how to take useful
            notes.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
            Eliminate <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1544246/" target="_blank">distractions</a>
            during class and study times. Multitasking is possible if the two activities
            engage different parts of the brain. Walking and chewing gum, for example, is
            multitasking. Neither activity disrupts the other (at least for most of us).
            Texting in class, or checking Facebook while studying, is not <a href="http://www.brainrules.net/attention" target="_blank">multitasking</a>,
            but rapid <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/brain-wise/201209/the-true-cost-multi-tasking" target="_blank">
                task switching
            </a>. The brain can only engage <a href="http://www.apa.org/monitor/2009/02/multitaskers.aspx" target="_blank">
                one of those activities at a time
            </a>, and there is a <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/digitalnation/interviews/nass.html" target="_blank">
                loss of cognition
            </a> during the “switching.” Research shows that even when good
            students <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/dept/CTL/ClassroomLaptops/wikiupload/1/17/Multitasking_Hembrooke.pdf" target="_blank">
                multitask in class
            </a>, their

                test scores
            </a> drop.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
            It might just be a good idea to <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28182528" target="_blank">
                ditch the device
            </a> and go back to taking notes the old fashioned way:
            <a href="http://www.npr.org/2016/04/17/474525392/attention-students-put-your-laptops-away" target="_blank">
                by hand
            </a>. Recent <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/a-learning-secret-don-t-take-notes-with-a-laptop/" target="_blank">research</a>
            shows that taking notes longhand is <a href="http://chronicle.com/article/The-Benefits-of-No-Tech-Note/228089/" target="_blank">
                more effective
            </a> than typing notes. And notetaking does not mean writing down everything your professor says; there is a 
            <a href="https://ivypanda.com/blog/everything-you-need-to-know-about-note-taking/" target="_blank">right way to do it</a> which is much more effective. 
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
            There is also evidence that frequent task shifting results in a
            <a href="http://www.learnoutloud.com/Free-Audio-Video/Social-Sciences/Psychology/What-the-Internet-Is-Doing-to-Our-Brains/38140" target="_blank">
                brain that is incapable

            is necessary for really <a href="http://www.pbs.org/mediashift/2014/09/why-clay-shirky-banned-laptops-tablets-and-phones-from-his-classroom/" target="_blank">
