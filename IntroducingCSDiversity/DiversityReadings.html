        </b> - (Available in the BSU library to the first person that gets there.)<br />
        "The information technology revolution is transforming almost every aspect of society, but girls and women are largely out of the loop.
        Although women surf the Web in equal numbers to men and make a majority of online purchases, few are involved in the design and creation
        of new technology. It is mostly men whose perspectives and priorities inform the development of computing innovations and who reap the
        lion's share of the financial rewards. As only a small fraction of high school and college computer science students are female, the field
        is likely to remain a "male clubhouse," absent major changes.In Unlocking the Clubhouse, social scientist Jane Margolis and computer
        scientist and educator Allan Fisher examine the many influences contributing to the gender gap in computing. The book is based on interviews
        with more than 100 computer science students of both sexes from Carnegie Mellon University, a major center of computer science research,
        over a period of four years, as well as classroom observations and conversations with hundreds of college and high school faculty. The
        interviews capture the dynamic details of the female computing experience, from the family computer kept in a brother's bedroom to women's
        feelings of alienation in college computing classes. The authors investigate the familial, educational, and institutional origins of the
        computing gender gap. They also describe educational reforms that have made a dramatic difference at Carnegie Mellon -- where the percentage
        of women entering the School of Computer Science rose from 7% in 1995 to 42% in 2000 -- and at high schools around the country."

        </b> - (Available in the BSU
        library to the first person that gets there.)<br />
        "The number of African Americans and Latino/as receiving undergraduate and advanced degrees in computer science is disproportionately low,
        according to recent surveys. And relatively few African American and Latino/a high school students receive the kind of institutional
        encouragement, educational opportunities, and preparation needed for them to choose computer science as a field of study and profession.
        In Stuck in the Shallow End, Jane Margolis looks at the daily experiences of students and teachers in three Los Angeles public high schools:
        an overcrowded urban high school, a math and science magnet school, and a well-funded school in an affluent neighborhood. She finds an
        insidious "virtual segregation" that maintains inequality. Two of the three schools studied offer only low-level, how-to (keyboarding,
        cutting and pasting) introductory computing classes. The third and wealthiest school offers advanced courses, but very few students of
        color enroll in them. The race gap in computer science, Margolis finds, is one example of the way students of color are denied a wide range
        of occupational and educational futures. Margolis traces the interplay of school structures (such factors as course offerings and
        student-to-counselor ratios) and belief systems -- including teachers' assumptions about their students and students' assumptions about
        themselves. Stuck in the Shallow End is a story of how inequality is reproduced in America -- and how students and teachers, given the
        necessary tools, can change the system."

        programmed the first digital computers — were women. And for decades, the number of women studying computer science was growing
        faster than the number of men. But in 1984, something changed. The percentage of women in computer science flattened, and then

        industry still take it for granted that this stereotype is the natural norm, and this perception is one of the things that is
        standing in our way to make the profession more inclusive and inviting. So where does this image come from? Did the demographics
        of the world's programmer population really evolve naturally, because 'boys just like computers more'? What shaped our perception

        "Yes, it is that bad.  The impassioned rhetoric surrounding diversity in tech isn’t hyperbolic; by every possible measure, a lack of
        inclusivity remains a damning, deplorable, distressing problem.  Consider this: In a recent
        <a href="https://fortune.com/2015/07/30/tech-companies-diveristy/" target="_blank">Fortune </a>survey of nine top tech companies,
        women comprised, on average, one-third of the workforce. Minorities, meanwhile, were found to make up “just a tiny fraction” of those
        workforces. Worse yet, representation was revealed to be even more dismal in leadership roles.  And lest you think things are changing—
        they’re not. Or at least, they’re changing at a glacial pace.  According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the
        <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/3052877/techs-big-gender-diversity-push-one-year-in" target="_blank">representation of women </a>
        in computer and mathematical operations is actually slightly worse than it was in 2010 (it has improved for underrepresented racial and
        ethnic minorities, but only slightly). More alarming, still, is that women
        <a href="https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d12/tables/dt12_349.asp" target="_blank">are earning just 18% </a>of computer science degrees . . .
        compared to 37% in back in 1985. Another
        <a href="https://www.informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/diversity-in-tech/" target="_blank">analysis </a>found that the major tech
        companies that had made the most progress in diversifying their
        workforces increased their hiring of women and people of color by a paltry 3%.  The situation is so bad, in fact, that it’s easy to stop
        paying attention, to resign oneself to a situation that feels both bleak and insurmountable.  But for the eight accomplished women behind
        <a href="https://projectinclude.org/team/" target="_blank">Project Include</a>—who have a cumulative 150 years of experience in the tech
        industry, and who have all lived the discrimination revealed by these troubling stats—resignation isn’t an option. The only way forward
        is a push for change to address the underlying issues that have stymied the industry." <i>Added 06/22/2016.</i>

        "As US universities struggle to encourage women to study computer science, one small college is having uncommon success attracting them to the
        field.  Harvey Mudd College, in Claremont, California, has been an outlier in producing female programmers for a decade. This year, for the
        first time, more women than men graduated with a degree in computer science. Nationally, about 16% of undergraduate computer-science majors
        are women. At Harvey Mudd, that figure is 55%. (It falls to 49% when joint majors are included.)" <i>Added 08/25/2016.</i>

        "Many people still think that racism is no longer a problem in America. After the election of President Obama, academic John McWhorter argued
        that racism in America is, for all intents and purposes, dead. The prominent conservative scholar and African-American economist Thomas Sowell
        has argued that 'racism isn't dead, but it is on life support.' Harvard professors William Julius Wilson and Roland Fryer too have argued about
        the declining significance of race and discrimination. However, as we wind down the final months of Obama's presidency, the declining significance
        of race and discrimination narratives seem to be at odds with the lived realities for African-Americans. President Obama himself has faced racist
        treatment, such as the birther controversy and a member of Congress saying 'you lie.' And then, one incident after another has highlighted the
        painful reality that black men are disproportionately likely to die at the hands of the police in comparison to any other demographic group."

        "Many science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) areas now show a gender parity – women earn about half of the undergraduate degrees in
        biology, chemistry and mathematics. This, however, is not true of all STEM areas – women earn fewer than one out of every five of the undergraduate
        degrees in computer science and engineering. The failure of computer science and engineering to recruit and graduate women is incredibly costly.
        These disciplines often offer high-paying jobs, and men’s greater participation in lucrative jobs in these fields perpetuates the gender gap in pay.
        That’s not all. When predominantly male engineering teams design lifesaving products, such as airbags and heart valves, they often do so with male
        bodies in mind. This has far-reaching implications – some of these products have caused injuries and deaths for women and children. My research
        shows gender gaps in computer science and engineering are a result of a masculine culture that dominates these fields."

        "It’s no secret that women, African Americans and Hispanics are underrepresented in computer science classrooms and careers.  Among students who
        take AP Computer Science courses in high school, for example, boys outnumber girls by more than 4 to 1. In 2013, only eight percent of students
        taking the AP CS exam were Hispanic and just three percent were African American. A recent report from Google and Gallup on diversity gaps in
        computer science education pointed to “structural and social barriers” for these three populations. It’s not enough to simply recruit
        underrepresented students to enroll in CS classes, say leaders in the field; once students are signed up, schools need do more to create inclusive
        classroom environments that position them for success. Last summer, Cynthia Lee, a lecturer in the computer science department at Stanford
        University, created a widely-circulated document called, “What can I do today to create a more inclusive community in CS?” The list was developed
        during a summer workshop funded by the National Science Foundation for newly hired computer science faculty and was designed for busy educators."

        "Even with projected growth of 15-20% between 2012 and 2022, the vast majority of computer science jobs will be pursued and filled by men. As
        STEM-related industries on a whole add over 1.7 million jobs in the coming years, there continues to be a notable absence of women in the field.
        This trend begins well before entering the job market: girls account for more than half of all Advanced Placement (AP) test-takers, yet boys
        outnumber girls 4:1 in computer science exams. In Mississippi, Montana and Wyoming, not a single girl took the AP Computer Science examination in
        2014.  There is a clear disconnect between the computer science industry and the message girls receive about their ability to succeed in tech
        organizations. This guide examines the history behind this disparity and how educators, parents, employers and computer scientists can reverse the
        trend."  Subsections include: 'The Current State of Women in Computer Science', 'Getting Started: How Do We Get Young Women Interested in CS?',
