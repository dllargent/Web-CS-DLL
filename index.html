        <h2 id="introduction">About me</h2>
        <p>
            I am an experienced, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student-centred_learning" target="_blank">learner-centered</a>
            university lecturer with more than 40 years of experience in systems analysis, programming, database design, teaching,
            overall business operations, and managing an information technology department in a medium sized company. After working in
            industry for nearly 30 years, I returned to academia and completed a master's degree in Computer Science at
            <a href="https://www.bsu.edu/" target="_blank">Ball State University</a> in 2010. I have been teaching full time at BSU since
            then. In addition to my teaching responsibilities, I serve as an advisor for the
            <a href="https://goldenkey.org/" target="_blank">Golden Key International Honour Society</a>
            <a href="https://www.facebook.com/GKBSU/" target="_blank">chapter at BSU</a>, and as a leader in the
            <a href="https://www.scouting.org/" target="_blank">Boy Scouts of America</a>. During past summers I have served as the camp
            director of a local scout camp.

            good procrastinator, assistant scout master, merit badge counselor, knot head,

            I enjoy being part of other’s learning, and especially like seeing a "light bulb" turn on when something
            suddenly "clicks" for a learner. I also find it very rewarding to mentor young adults as they take on, and
            learn the meaning of, leadership.

            My advice is to check back sporadically and randomly.<br />
